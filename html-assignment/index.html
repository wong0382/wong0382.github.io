        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>This is Hildy from Hong Kong, doing coding for the first time in my life. Starting to understand how codes work. Looking forward to learning in the course, and find some excitement but hopefully not too challenging. My previous experience with building a website is dragging elements into a WordPress page. </p>
        <p>Learning coding can help develop further my interest in data visualisation, which is one of my career goals when I graduate. I love the way when data or numbers meet design. Graphics can help deliver the message way better than just showing a data sheet. However most of the data tools require some knowledge of coding, so I need to learn codes before I keep developing my goal.</p>
