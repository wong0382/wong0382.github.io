    <p>This is Hildy from Hong Kong, doing coding for the first time in my life. Looking forward to learning a lot in the course, find some excitement but not too challenging. </p>

    <p>Learning coding can help develop further my interest in data visualisation, which is one of my career goals when I graduate.</p>
